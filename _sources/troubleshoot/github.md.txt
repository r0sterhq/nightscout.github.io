## Lost access to GitHub

Not a big problem:

### Create a GitHub account

```{include} /vendors/github/create.md

```

</br>

------

### Fork the Nightscout project

```{include} /vendors/github/fork.md

```

</br>

You'll need to reconnect your app to GitHub.

</br>

-------

## Cannot update GitHub

When encountering update issues with GitHub, the easiest method it to delete it and fork the project again.

### Delete your own fork of cgm-remote-monitor

```{include} /vendors/github/delete.md

```

### Fork the Nightscout project

```{include} /vendors/github/fork.md

```

</br>

You'll need to reconnect your app to GitHub.
